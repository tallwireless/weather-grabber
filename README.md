# Git Template for Python
This is my Git repo template for python. It has the proper `.gitignore` files,
along with the standard pre-commit hooks to keep the repo looking nice.

After cloning, run the following to get everything setup for the local
environment:

    # python3 -m venv env
    # source env/bin/activate
    # pip3 install -r reqs.txt
    # pre-commit install

This will get everything setup for you and provide you with the base
environment.
